Artificial intelligence (AI) startup Scatterlab announced on the 6th that the Nutty messenger app, which allows conversations with the AI chatbot "Iruda 2.0" with the concept of female college students in their 20s, surpassed a cumulative 1 million downloads in 41 days after its official launch.

Iruda 2.0 has been conducting beta tests for about nine months since January to verify speech function and service stability. Scatterlab explained that the version, which was officially released in October, has enabled more creative and realistic conversations through a total of three AI technology updates.

The total amount of conversations Iruda and users had exceeded 43,000 cumulative cases. Last month, the average daily active user (DAU) recorded 140,000 and the weekly active user (WAU) recorded 300,000.

The gender ratio of the users who talked to Lee Luda was evenly matched between men and women. In particular, it was popular among 10 to 20 generations. Their proportion recorded 89% of all users. The amount of photo conversation through 'PhotoChat Beta' technology that recognizes and answers photos during conversation has also increased.

Kim Jong-yoon, CEO of Scatter Lab, said, "There are many users who are surprised and have fun with the AI conversation ability that speaks well like a human being while talking to Luda," adding, "We will expand our experience so that we can communicate with users in various forms as well as with our friends."
